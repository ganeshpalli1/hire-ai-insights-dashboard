# Video Interview 404 Error Fix

## Problem
The video interview links were returning 404 errors after deployment because the React SPA (Single Page Application) routing was not properly configured for server-side routing.

## Root Cause
When users accessed URLs like `/video-interview?session=xyz`, the web server was trying to find a physical file or server route called `video-interview`, but since this is a React SPA, all routing should be handled by React Router on the client side.

## Solution
Added proper server configuration files to redirect all non-asset requests to `index.html` so React Router can handle the routing:

### Files Added/Modified:

1. **`web.config`** - For IIS/Azure Web Apps deployment
   - Redirects all SPA routes to index.html
   - Excludes API calls and static assets
   - Adds security headers and compression

2. **`.htaccess`** - For Apache servers
   - Handles client-side routing for React SPA
   - Sets security headers and caching

3. **`public/_redirects`** - For Netlify/Vercel deployment
   - Simple redirect rule for SPA routing

## How the Video Interview Flow Works:

1. **Link Generation**: Backend generates URL like `/video-interview?session={session_id}`
2. **User Access**: User clicks the link and navigates to the URL
3. **Server Routing**: Server redirects to `index.html` (instead of 404)
4. **Client Routing**: React Router takes over and loads the VideoInterview component
5. **Session Loading**: Component extracts session ID from URL params and loads interview data

## Deployment Instructions:

### For Azure Web Apps:
- The `web.config` file should be in the root of your deployment
- Make sure you're deploying the built React app (from `dist/` folder after `npm run build`)

### For Apache Servers:
- The `.htaccess` file should be in the document root
- Ensure mod_rewrite is enabled

### For Netlify/Vercel:
- The `_redirects` file in the `public/` folder will be copied to the deployment root
- No additional configuration needed

## Testing:
1. Build your React app: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the contents of the `dist/` folder
3. Test the video interview link - it should now load correctly instead of showing 404

## Technical Details:
- The VideoInterview component extracts the session ID using: `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('session')`
- The backend generates session URLs with format: `/video-interview?session={session_id}`
- All routes except API calls, assets, and specific files are redirected to index.html
