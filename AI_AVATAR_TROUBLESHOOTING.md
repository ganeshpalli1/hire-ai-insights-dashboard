## üìä How to Debug Video Issues

### Step 1: Open Browser Developer Tools

2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Look for video-related log messages

### Step 2: Test Video Access
1. Click the **"Test Transcript"** button (this also tests video access)
2. Check console for:
   - `‚úÖ Video file is accessible` (good)
   - `‚ùå Video file not accessible` (problem)

### Step 3: Manual Video Test
1. Click the **"Test Video"** button in the transcript area
2. Check for success/error toast messages
3. Review console logs for detailed error info

AI Video: Playing
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Video file not accessible" (404 Error)
**Symptoms**: Console shows HTTP 404 status
**Solution**: 
- Ensure `dist/ai-avatar.mp4` exists after build
- Redeploy the complete `dist/` folder
- Check web server configuration

### Issue 2: Video loads but won't play
**Symptoms**: Video status shows "Ready" but no playback
**Solutions**:
1. **Autoplay Restrictions**: Many browsers block autoplay
   - User must interact with page first
   - Click "Test Video" button after page loads
   
2. **MIME Type Issues**:
   - Ensure server serves .mp4 files correctly
   - Content-Type should be `video/mp4`

3. **Video Format Issues**:
   - MP4 format should be compatible
   - Check video codec (H.264 recommended)

### Issue 3: Browser Compatibility
**Symptoms**: Works in some browsers, not others
**Solutions**:
- Added `playsInline` for mobile Safari
- Added explicit `<source>` tag with MIME type
- Video element includes fallback text

### Issue 4: Network/Loading Issues
**Symptoms**: Video takes long to load or stalls
**Solutions**:
- 27MB file may be large for slow connections
- Video preloads metadata only (not full file)
- Consider video compression for production

## üß™ Testing Checklist

## üîÑ Quick Fix Steps

If video still doesn't work:

- Verify MIME type configuration

### General Web Servers:
- Ensure .mp4 files are served with correct MIME type
- Check for file size upload/serving limits
- Verify HTTP/HTTPS mixed content policies
